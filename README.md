# karma
A cuberite plugin that effects players by their deeds.  
That mean you will get 'Sin' when doing something bad, such as damage forest or kill animals...  
Inversely,you will get 'Merits' when doing something well,such as plant trees and kill mobs...  
So,if you more 'Sin' than 'Merits',you may get punishment when you respawn or be going berserk, else get reword or get skill treatment.
